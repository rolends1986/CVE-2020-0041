# Uses the bug described here, http://blog.gdssecurity.com/labs/2015/2/25/
# jetleak-vulnerability-remote-leakage-of-shared-buffers-in-je.html, to
# repeatedly request sequential, chunks of memory and store them in a string
# The script will continue to run until it has captured 1000 bytes or it has
# had to wait for two minutes. Receiving a block of null bytes will cause a
# five second wait. After 24 of these 5 second waits the script will stop
# unless it gets 1000 bytes of data first.
